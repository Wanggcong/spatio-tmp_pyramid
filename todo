-- make the generation of partition better, ie no longer axis-aligned

-- much freedom in playing with partition generation

-- should all the datapoints, even those with invalid labels, participate in the object distribution calculation?

--find out what is in datafile

-- setting threshold to .012 ups the accuracy a bit.. should be investigated more
maybe parameterized

-- look at the creation of histograms... can it be improved, made more like R

-- refactor so that make_pool takes varargin, make randrs optional param
