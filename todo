--problem in applying a partition. output of the function doesnt seem to match for some reason

-- make the generation of partition better, ie no longer axis-aligned

-- much freedom in playing with partition generation

-- compute_obj_distr should be a method on the new object

-- should all the datapoints, even those with invalid labels, participate in the object distribution calculation?

-- boost_main and compute_boost_stats are very similar
--find out what is in datafile


-- compare ramanan and boosting

-- graph what happens to the accuracy as pool size increases

-- bias the creation of pool
