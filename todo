--setting num_levels to 1 in boost_main leads to a problem with making the partition in make_pool>make_partition
	(partition output arg not asssigned)

--problem in applying a partition. output of the function doesnt seem to match for some reason

-- make the generation of partition better, ie no longer axis-aligned

-- much freedom in playing with partition generation

-- data sub is in train_an_test

-- move the get inv stuff from compute_obj_distr to the randgen object
